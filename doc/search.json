Also useful are temporal diagrams showing how a particular process unfolds over time.

Die Physik hat ein solches Narrativ; es ist der Glaube an die Sphärenmusik einer kosmischen Harmonie, erkennbar an dem Vertrauen, mit dem man erwartet, auf Symmetrien, Erhaltungssätze und überhaupt auf einfache Zusammenhänge zu stoßen. Die Psychologen haben sich dieses Narrativ ausgeborgt; aber bei ihnen funktioniert es nicht.\n\n\nAuch für sie aber läge ein solcher Kompass bereit, und die Systemtheorie könnte sie lehren, ihn zu nutzen. Den Technikern ist er seit je vertraut, und ebenso ordnet und lenkt er das Denken der Biologen […]. Dieses heuristische Narrativ - wir werden es in diesem Buch unter dem Stichwort des demiurgischen Prinzips kennenlernen - ist die Vision des kosmischen Ingenieurs, des Weltbaumeisters, der den Organismus unter der Leitidee nicht der Harmonie, sondern der Funktionalität, des “Wozu” konstruiert hat.\n\n\n\nSee Bischof (2021), “Struktur und Bedeutung”"

Most of the replication studies […] employed the CDQ as their stimulus set, and they generally had no trouble obtaining the basic risky shift result.”\nToday we know that there is no risky shift. “It is now clear that the items contained in the original CDQ are in no sense a representative sample of the universe of all possible items. Instruments similar to the CDQ could readily be constructed whose scores would display risky shifts, cautious ones, or none at all” (Cartwright, 1971, p. 368).\nIn the early risky shift literature, theoretical progress was unnecessarily impeded by multiple generations of replication studies (k ⋍ 200), nearly all relying on the same CQD questionnaire.\n\n\n\nSee Westfall et al. (2015).

Die Physik hat ein solches Narrativ; es ist der Glaube an die Sphärenmusik einer kosmischen Harmonie, erkennbar an dem Vertrauen, mit dem man erwartet, auf Symmetrien, Erhaltungssätze und überhaupt auf einfache Zusammenhänge zu stoßen. Die Psychologen haben sich dieses Narrativ ausgeborgt; aber bei ihnen funktioniert es nicht.\n\n\nAuch für sie aber läge ein solcher Kompass bereit, und die Systemtheorie könnte sie lehren, ihn zu nutzen. Den Technikern ist er seit je vertraut, und ebenso ordnet und lenkt er das Denken der Biologen […].

    "text": "This is the email I sent to the colleagues in my department:\n\nSubject: We formalize your theory!\n\nBody:\nDear colleagues,\nthis semester, we want to explore something new. In my upcoming Empra (for 5th semester students), the participants get acquainted with formal modeling of psychological theories. The goal is to develop a mathematical or agent-based model of a verbal theory. In this project, …\n\nthe central phenomena are listed (What is to be explained?)\nthe verbal theory is explicated, and\na theory formalization is attempted (in a way that data can be simulated from the model).\n\nWe wanted to ask you - the colleagues in the department - if you want to submit a theory for this exercise.\nHere are some FAQs:\n\nWhat theory would be a good fit?\n\nA theory that is sufficiently precise and has a defined and not too large scope\nIts core premises are formulated in a clear and concise form on one (or only few) pages.\nThere doesn’t exist a formalized theory yet (e.g., it would be hard to re-create decades of theory building on the drift-diffusion model within a single course).\n\n\n\nWhat theory would not be a good fit?\n\nYou need to read three books to understand the theory.\nThe “all-encompassing theory of human nature”\nYou need a lot of expert input and judgement to fill in the gaps of the underspecified theory.\nYou need very specific domain knowledge to even understand the basic phenomena and constructs of the theory.\n\n\n\nBut don’t you lack domain knowledge?\nIn an ideal world, theories are so well specified that they can be formalized without further expert opinions. But as this is unrealistic in psychology, we need your input (see next question).\n\n\nWhat is my necessary commitment?\n\nProvide the written material for the theory.\nTwo or three meetings (each lasting ~2h) during the Empra’s teaching hours (XXX):\n\nMeeting 1 where you give a very short overview of the theory (after the students have already read the written material) and we discuss first steps.\nMeeting 2 where students present intermediate results and can ask questions for clarification.\n(optional) Meeting 3, where students present their results to you.\nIf you enjoy and benefit from the scientific discussion, of course more meetings are possible and welcome.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens with the results?\nThe created models will be published with a CC-BY license. That means, you can reuse everything with a proper citation. If the models are really helpful (and more than just a vague inspiration for further work), we can think about a follow-up collaboration and write-up (where collaboration and co-authorship is offered to the student creators of the model).\n\n\nThe procedure would be as follows:\n\nWe collect candidate theories for formalization until 30.10.2023.\nWe screen all submissions and select one or two theories (depending on their complexity).\nIf your theory is selected, we will meet:\n\nFor the introductory meeting (xx.xx.2023, ~2h)\nFor the intermediate meeting (xx.xx.2024, ~2h)\nFor the results presentation (xx.xx.2024, ~2h)\n\n\nIf you want to participate, please send an email to xxx by xx.xx.2023, containing a short description of the theory (max. 200 words) and a link to a central paper describing the theory. It can be “your” theory, or an existing theory that you work with.\nA final caveat: We are aware that this collaboration requires a non-negligible time investment from you. At the same time, this is highly experimental and we cannot promise any success or even progress. But in any case we expect good scientific discussions and are convinced that the exercise is fruitful for all parties.\nIf you have any questions, drop me an email.\n\nHere are some (anonymized) reactions I got:\n\n“EPIC!”\n“A very good idea. Just trying it would fulfil my heart’s desire”\n\nAt the end, XX theories got submitted. We discussed them and selected YY of them"
