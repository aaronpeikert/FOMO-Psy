# Group formation {#sec-group_formation}

## Goal:

- Put together groups where also unacquainted people meet -> increase network size.
- Allow a certain freedom of choice, not completely random.
- Ensure that at least one person is knowledgable of programming.

## Create a "visual analog scale" (VAS) of programming skills in the room

While carrying their name tags, students find their position between two corners of the rooms, described as:

1. "No programming knowledge at all, I even forgot everything I learned about R programming in the first semester"
2. "I actively coded (in any language) in the last 3 months"

## Semi-randomised allocation:

- Collect all name tags, in the order of programming skills in the VAS.
- Build 4 working islands (push tables together).
- Distribute the name tags of the 4 most capable programmers in the room on the 4 tables.
- Then select the next 4 names, who choose an island to join. But only 1 person is allowed to join each island at each round.

## Round of introductions within the group (10 min)

- Task: Think of a funny name for a donkey.
- Give a more detailed introduction to the other group members:
  - Career goals / type of psychologist they want to become
  - Specific programming skills


# Git Intro {#sec-git}

1. Showcase how git works
   1. Create a private project on Github. This will be the central project for submitting homework
   2. Show how to commit, push, pull changes.
2. We start the [OSC git tutorial](https://malikaihle.github.io/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/) together to weed out technical hurdles. The rest of tutorial is homework.


# Homework {#sec-homework}

Please continue the tutorial ["Introduction to Version Control in R with RStudio, Git, and Github"](https://malikaihle.github.io/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/), **and** complete the follow-up tutorial "[Collaborative coding with GitHub and RStudio](https://malikaihle.github.io/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/)".
Depending on your prior knowledge, completing both tutorials will take between 30 min. and 2.5h.
