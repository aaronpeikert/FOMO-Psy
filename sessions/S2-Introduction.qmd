# Homework {#sec-homework}

## [Install Netlogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/bind/article/getting-started-with-netlogo.html). 
If you have technical problems, please contact me! You should be prepared for the next session.

## Do a basic tutorial. There are several options, which all teach the basics:
   a) A [free, self-paced online course](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/84-fundamentals-of-netlogo/materials) with several short videos (total video material ~2h; in addition, one can do quizzes and "homework" that can be compared to solutions).
   b) If you prefer written material, you can do the official tutorials [1](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/tutorial1.html), [2](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/tutorial2.html), and [3](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/tutorial3.html).
   c) The [Beginner's Interactive NetLogo Dictionary](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/bind/) is a great resources with references and examples for all commands.

## Have you understood the basics? Do the exercise

Please do the following exercise. Not every step might have been covered by the tutorials; in this case follow the links given at each task. 
Push the resulting `.nlogo` file to the joint Github project (subfolder `/homework/netlogo-tutorial`, filename is `netlogo1_YOURNAME.nlogo`). Please push whatever you came up with, even if you did not manage to achieve all goals.
